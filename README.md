# Monopoly
This project aims to create a web based playable version of the popular board game Monopoly. The game should be playable by a user or users. Additionally, there will be an option to play with a bot so that a single player can also enjoy the game. This project will use a GUI package and website design to construct the base game, and machine learning to analyze and optimize the botâ€™s decisions. 


# User Guide
Some specialized packages used include pygame, pygbag, asyncio, random, sys, and myProject.
The conda environment I used to test and develop this project is shown in the environment.yml file


To run the game on a local host broswer, ensure the myProject file with its contents is in the same file directory as main.py. Then in your terminal, activate your conda environment, and change directory to the file right before the one main.py is in. Finally, run "pygbag {filename}" and in your browser, go to http://localhost:8000. Now hit "ready to start" and have fun!
