# Monopoly
This project aims to create a web based playable version of the popular board game Monopoly. The game should be playable by a user or users. This project will use the pygame GUI package to construct the gameâ€™s graphics. It will also use the pygbag package to implement the pygame graphics and internal game logic on a locally hosted web address that can accept user inputs and implement the corresponding background game logic.


# User Guide
Some specialized packages used include pygame, pygbag, asyncio, random, sys, and myProject.
The conda environment I used to test and develop this project is shown in the environment.yml file


To run the game on a local host broswer, ensure the myProject file with its contents is in the same file directory as main.py. Then in your terminal, activate your conda environment, and change directory to the folder right before the one main.py is in. Finally, run "pygbag {foldername}" and in your browser, go to http://localhost:8000. Now hit "ready to start" and have fun!
